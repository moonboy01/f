        There are some type of accounts that have higher profit share and different weights: </br></br>
        
        > <b>1) Referrer is a standard type of accounts</b>, and is set to default with 10% profit share. If the referrer has a sub referrer the total profit share will not change, but will split 6% to main referer and 4% to second referer.</br></br>
        
        > <b>2) The second level of Referrer is a Partner program.</b> Enyone can be a Partner by interacting with our smart contract from the Referral page (available only on ETH), the cost of Subscription is 1 ETH and is unatantum. </br>

        How it works? Every time a user use the dapp with your referral link, the dapp automatically check if your address is mapped as a "Partner" on our Smart Contract. 
        If you are a Partner you will get a total quote of 26%. Splitted 16% / 10% between the referrer and subreferrer.</br>
    </br>
        > You can check if your address is registered as a partner on the dapp homepage using your referral link, click on get started, 
        so click on the footer text ( © Snapper.fi 2022 ), and let the website load the your data. </br>

<a style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Direct Communication</b></a></br>
<p>> How to use Notes (Only for registered users): notes are an easy way to comunicate with a specific user. You will see a note change if we see an high activity on your account. Team will read only note update by selected users, so if you try to contact us via note is probably we will not read it.</br>
<b>Note of registration:</b> Server will be cleaned randomly for privacy reasons. Your Users Data (Email, Note, Referer...) will be delete permanently but all data about your address status (like Partner & Special Partner) will be maintained.</br>
</br>> Email is a good other way, in any case the first mail will always send directly by us with a disposable mail. The title of the mail WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME as a Note key we will provide to you in a note box (remember to clear the browser cache to be able to read updated notes), so you can be sure that you are really talking with the team.</p>
