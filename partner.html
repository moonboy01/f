<a style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Direct Communication</b></a></br>
<p>> How use Note (Subscription): note are an easy way to comunicate with a specific user. You will see a note changed if we see an high activity on your account. Team will read only note update by selected users, so if you try to contact us via note is probably we will not read it.</br>
</br>> Email is a good other way, in any case the first mail will always send directly by us with a disposable mail. The title of the mail WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME as a Note key we will provide to you in a note box (remember clear cache), so you can be sure that you are really talking with the team.</p>
